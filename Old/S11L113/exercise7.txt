// 1. Create an object that has properties "username" and "password". Fill those values in with strings.

var account = {
  username: "jimtest",
  password: "12345"
};

// 2. Create an array which contains the object you have made above and name the array "database".

var database = [{username: "jimtest", password: "12345"}];

// 3. Create an array called "newsfeed" which contains 3 objects with properties "username" and "timeline".

var newsfeed = [{username: "test1", timeline: "2019"},{username: "test2", timeline: "2018"},{username: "test3", timeline: "2017"}];
